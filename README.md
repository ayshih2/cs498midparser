# Parser for peer evaluations in CS 498 Mobile Interactive Design

* probably v inefficient
* 8 teams is hard coded in
* prints netid, team number, teammates and the scores given to individual, averaged score and own score to console
* writes formatted version (ready to be copy and pasted to Compass) to a file
* basic idea was to read all students in from csv file, then go through individual peer evaluations to find grade they gave to themselves and average grades others gave to them
